# **From The Earth**

From The Earth aims to create an all new survival experience, loosely based on TerraFirmaCraft. FTE's main goal is to provide a challenging, but fair experience for new and veteran players alike.

While FTE is still very in-development, the current planned features are all new ore and tree generation, as well as more immersive and engaging crafting systems.

It likely will not be compatible with many mods out of the box, and will require extensive modification through datapacks to work properly.
